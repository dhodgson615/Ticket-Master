## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py /path/to/your/repo owner/repo-name
```

### Dry Run (recommended first)
Test what issues would be created without actually creating them:
```bash
python main.py /path/to/your/repo owner/repo-name --dry-run
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Use custom configuration
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --config config.yaml

# Limit number of issues
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --max-issues 3

# Enable debug logging
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --log-level DEBUG

# Combine options
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --dry-run --max-issues 2 --log-level INFO
```

### Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:
```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your preferred settings
```

The configuration file allows you to set:
- Default labels for generated issues
- Repository analysis parameters
