A project that attempts to use AI to suggest GitHub issues with descriptions
based on the contents of a Git repository

## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhodgson615/Ticket-Master.git
cd Ticket-Master
```

2. One-command setup (installs dependencies and creates config):
```bash
make setup
```

3. Set up your GitHub token:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhodgson615/Ticket-Master.git
cd Ticket-Master
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

### Available Make Targets

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

- `make setup` - One-command setup: install dependencies and copy config
- `make install` - Install Python dependencies only
- `make test` - Run tests with coverage
- `make lint` - Run linting checks
- `make typecheck` - Run type checking with mypy

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py /path/to/your/repo owner/repo-name
```

### Dry Run (recommended first)
Test what issues would be created without actually creating them:
```bash
python main.py /path/to/your/repo owner/repo-name --dry-run
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Use custom configuration
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --config config.yaml

# Limit number of issues
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --max-issues 3

# Enable debug logging
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --log-level DEBUG

# Combine options
python main.py /path/to/repo owner/repo --dry-run --max-issues 2 --log-level INFO
```

### Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and customize it:
```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your preferred settings
```

The configuration file allows you to set:
- Default labels for generated issues
- Repository analysis parameters
- Issue generation limits
- LLM settings (for future implementation)
